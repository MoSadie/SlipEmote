## v1.0.0

### Initial Release!

After falling into a small rabbit hole due to a community suggestion, I'm proud to present a brand new plugin!

This plugin allows you to bind emotes to certain keys, just like the quick emote button, but you get to set the emote!

All configuration options can be found in the README, but here's a quick summary of how to use this:

1) Load onto any ship
2) Use an emote
3) Press the `~` key to start binding the emote to a key
4) Press the emote key you want to bind the emote to (0-9 on the number row) (Or press `~` again to cancel)
5) Emote!
